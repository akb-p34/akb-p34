***`Student of Capitalism (Learner/Entrepreneur/Pioneer)`***

I'm a third-year Quantitative Finance student at Stevens Institute of Technology, centered on **shaping innovative solutions** to real-world problems. When I reimagined Sports Car analysis using Data Science or automated Trading Strategies with Machine Learning, I focused on finding the *effective solution.* One of my trading models, designed from scratch, **achieved over 40% CAGR**, demonstrating my commitment to results-driven approaches. By combining Python, C++, and Tableau, I consistently push the boundaries of what's possible, achieving real-world results that are ***both practical and profitable***.

> "My approach is simple: Break the problem down to first principles, then solve it with articulated logic and effort."
