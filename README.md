I'm a third-year Quantitative Finance student at Stevens Institute of Technology, centered on **providing innovative solutions** to real-world problems. When I reimagined Sports Car analysis using Data Science or automated Trading Strategies with Machine Learning, I focused on finding the *successful solution.* One of my trading models, designed from scratch, achieved over 40% CAGR, demonstrating my commitment to results-driven approaches. By combining Python, C++, and Tableau, I consistently push the boundaries of what's possible, achieving real-world results that are ***both profitable and practical***.
